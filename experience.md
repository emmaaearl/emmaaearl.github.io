I am currently finishing my second quarter of being a learning assistant for general chemistry classes here at Cal Poly. I have learned a lot by helping other students learn chemistry and it has made me like it even more. It has also been a super great way for me to solidify my understanding of basic chemistry concepts that I will be using in future chemistry courses. 

I am also a member of an organic synthesis research group at Cal Poly where we are working with alkoxyamines for many different purposes. I have learned so much from being in the lab and working with other student researchers.
