I am a 2nd year chemistry major and biotechnology minor at California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo. I knew I wanted to study chemistry ever since I took chemistry in high school. I thought the subject was fascinating and it just came naturally to me. I completed the general chemistry series and am working my way through the organic chemistry series at the moment. So far I am super interested in the organic chemistry field and all of the applications it has. I am a member of a research group that focuses on organic synthesis and so far find it super fun and interesting! I am also minoring in biotechnology to learn more about another field and how it relates to chemistry and I am super excited to get started with those courses.   

### More Information

In my free time I enjoy spending lots of time outside. Some of my favorite activities are hiking, going to the beach, and exploring the city of San Luis Obispo. I am originally from Washington so I miss the greenery sometimes but I love being close to the water and trying out a small town by living in SLO.
